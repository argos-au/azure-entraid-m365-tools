    DESCRIPTION:
      This script:
        - Creates an App Registration in Entra ID (Azure AD).
        - Maps text permission names (e.g. "Application.Read.All") to GUID-based resource permissions 
          in the Microsoft Graph service principal.
        - Adds them as application (role) or delegated (scope) permissions to your new app.
        - Grants admin consent.
        - Generates a client secret valid for 6 months and outputs the final app info.

    REQUIRES:
      - Microsoft Graph PowerShell module installed
      - An active connection (Connect-MgGraph) with sufficient privileges
